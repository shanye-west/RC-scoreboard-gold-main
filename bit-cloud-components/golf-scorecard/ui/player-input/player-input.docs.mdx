## Component usage

The `PlayerInput` component allows users to enter names and handicaps for players, typically for a golf scorecard. It supports adding and removing players within a configurable range.

## Basic Player Input

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `PlayerInput` component. By default, it renders input fields for 2 players and allows adding up to a maximum of 4 players.

```tsx
<PlayerInput />
```
## Player Input with Initial Data
You can pre-populate the `PlayerInput` component with existing player data using the `initialPlayers` prop. This is useful when loading a saved game or pre-filling known participants.
```tsx
<PlayerInput
  initialPlayers={[
    { id: 'p1', name: 'Alice Wonderland', handicap: 10 },
    { id: 'p2', name: 'Bob The Builder', handicap: 18 },
    { id: 'p3', name: 'Charlie Brown', handicap: 22 },
  ]}
/>
```
## Configured Player Input
This example shows how to configure the minimum and maximum number of players allowed. Here, the component is set up to strictly handle 4 players, disabling add/remove functionality once the limit is reached.
```tsx
<PlayerInput
  initialPlayers={[
    { id: 'plyr1', name: 'Golfer One', handicap: 5 },
    { id: 'plyr2', name: 'Player Two', handicap: 12 },
    { id: 'plyr3', name: 'Participant Three', handicap: 20 },
    { id: 'plyr4', name: 'User Four', handicap: 8 },
  ]}
  minPlayers={4}
  maxPlayers={4}
/>
